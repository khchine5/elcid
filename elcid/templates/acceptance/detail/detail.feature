As a Doctor
I need to see the full details concerning an episode of care
So that I can get the full picture of the condition of the Patient rather
than simply the most commonly relevant information for one context.

Given a Patient that exists on the service
When I search for that Patient
When I click on the name
Then I should be taken to a Patient detail view
