As a User
I need to record additional fields when I give/stop giving antimicrobials

when I'm the list view, I click on Antimicrobial. It asks me for
delivered by, adverse events, reason for stopping and comments.

I can fill these in and they will save. I will be able to see delivered
by in the record panel.
