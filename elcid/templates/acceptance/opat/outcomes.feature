As a Doctor
I need to record patient outcome, OPAT outcome, and primary infective diagnosis
so that I can fulfill audit requirements

Given a patient that has been added to OPAT referrals and confirmed
When I click the "Completed IV" action button
When I fill in patient outcome, OPAT outcome and primary infective diagnosis
When I then search for the patient name
Then the outcomes data is displayed in the outcome record panel
