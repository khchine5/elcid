As a Doctor
I need to record patient outcome, OPAT outcome, and primary infective diagnosis
so that I can fulfill audit requirements

Given a patient that has been added to OPAT referrals and confirmed
I click the "Completed IV" action button
I fill in patient outcome, OPAT outcome and primary infective diagnosis
I then search for the patient name and see the data stored in the outcome record
panel
