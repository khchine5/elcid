As a User
I need to refer a Patient to the OPAT service
So that the OPAT service can triage the referral and decide whether the patient
is suitable for OPAT care

Given that I am on the OPAT referrals list
When I click add Patient
When I complete the modals with a new Patient
Then that Patient should be added to the OPAT referrals list
