As a Nurse
I need to quickly add common investigations for a Patient
So that the data entry for tests we do very frequently does not hold up our
delivery of care

Given that I am on the Walkin Nurse Triage list
When I click the Investigations button
When I select the investigations by checkbox
When I click save
Then an Investigation should have been added to the Patient for each checkbox
