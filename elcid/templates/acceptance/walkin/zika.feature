I need to be able to draft a zika letter. This warns the GP of possible exporsure to
the zika virus.

Given that I am in the Walkin patient list and have added a patient.
Given that I can click a button that says ZIKA letter, a letter should
appear containing their recent travel and if they're pregnant
