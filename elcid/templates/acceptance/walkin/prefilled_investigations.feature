As a User
I need every patient added to Walkin to have an HIV Point of Care test
So that the system automatically prompts me to offer this to every patient. Because
we should be offering this to anyone attending this service

Given that I am on the Walkin Nurse triage list
When I add a patient
Then that patient should automatically be given an Investigation entry for HIV Point of Care
