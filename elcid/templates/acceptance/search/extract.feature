As a Researcher
I need to extract data
So that I can perform arbitrary analysis on the high quality structured
data we have captured on the service, and answer research or service
audit questions.

Given that I have made an advanced search with some results
Given that I have the extract permissions enabled
When I click download these results
Then I should download a zip file containing the raw data as CSV files
