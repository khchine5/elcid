As a Doctor
I need to be able to use elCID with a tablet device.

Given that I am on a tablet looking at a specific patient in the view.
Then I should be able to click on the plus icon next to a subrecord header
to add an item.

Then I should be able to click on the pen icon next to a subrecord to edit an
item.
