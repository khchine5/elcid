As an Administrator
I need to be able add a patients diagnosis when I add them
to the system.
So that the patient can be handled by the liason service.

Given that I am in the haem referral.
Then I should be be able to search for a patient.

Given that the patient is found.
Then I should be able to add in diagnosis for that patient

If the patient is not found.
Then I should be able to add in patient details and then add
in a diagnosis for that patient.
