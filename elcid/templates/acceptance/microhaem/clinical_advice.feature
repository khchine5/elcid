As a Doctor
I need to be able to enter advice on the Micro Haem view.
So that I can record my clinical practice, allowing me to understand it better, and also explain
to colleagues the nature of the service I deliver

Given that I am viewing the Micro Haem view for a Patient
Given that I have entered advice via the pages clinical advice form
Then the advice should appear in the correct order in the timeline below.
Then the initial in the form should default to the user's initials.
Then the reason for interaction and discussed with with fields in the form should default to the information previously entered in the form
