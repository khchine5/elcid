As a Micro Haem Doctor
I need to access the Micro Haem view
So that I can view the information relevant to my clinical service

Given that I have the micro_haem role
When I search for a Patient that exists on the service
Then I should see a Microbiology Haematology Consult link in the search results
When I click the link
Then I should be taken to the Micro Haem view
