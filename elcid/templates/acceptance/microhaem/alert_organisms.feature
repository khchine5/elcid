As a Doctor
I need to flag investigation results as Alerts
So that the service can highlight these results when users are viewing this Patient

Given that I am creating an Investigation for a Patient
Then I should be able to mark the Investigation as an Alert Investigation

Given that I am viewing the Micro Haem view for a Patient
Given that the Patient has an Alert Investigation
Then that Investigation should be highlighted
